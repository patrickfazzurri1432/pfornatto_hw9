# Business Analytics Student Survey

This is a simple multi-page web form built to collect insights from BAIS students at the University of Iowa. It asks about students' backgrounds and their impressions of the major.

## Form Design & Best Practices

I used clear labels, logical input types (like radio buttons and checkboxes), and grouped related questions to make the form easy to follow. The layout is clean thanks to Bootstrap, and tooltips provide extra help without cluttering the page. I also included required field indicators and simple validation to improve the experience.

## Accessibility

I followed accessibility best practices by linking labels to inputs, ensuring keyboard navigation works, and fixing contrast issues. Tooltips and form elements are screen-reader-friendly, and the design meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
